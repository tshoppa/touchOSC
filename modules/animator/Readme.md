# TouchOSC Layout Animator
Rearranging the controls in a template while it is running might sometimes be neccessary to meet different user preferences.
Examples are
  - switching right- to lefthanded layouts
  - simple vs advanced settings
  - vertical vs horizontal layouts
  - switching focus by enlarging certain areas of a template
  - create alternative pagers

Animator helps to build and manage multiple layouts in a template. You can just record snapshots of control arrangements, their positions, size and orientation.
Everything is build into a single radio control that you can later use to switch through the layouts. 

Moreover, you can also add animations between layout switches, making transitions much easier to understand and more fun to watch.
