# touchOSC
These are 2 dialogs I developed for an application that needed more user interaction than touchOSC surfaces usually do.

## Text Input
A dialog to enter a text. I needed it to name sound patches to be saved in an external synth.
It features lower and uppercase characters as well as a range of symbols. The keyboard layout is QUERTY (for characters, the symbols are more or less random).
For more details see the [description in the module folder](https://github.com/tshoppa/touchOSC/blob/main/modules/TextInputDialog/README.md).
